# Matlab
Here are some MATLAB codes I created for my System Theory course at the BHT Berlin.

A4  :  Plot of 6 signals made of Unit-Step funtion
A5  :  Plot of two signals and Energy 
A6  :  Plot of LTI-systems output signals / convulation integral
A7  :  Convulation
A10 :  Fourier Transform
A11 :  Spektrum of a convulation Integral
